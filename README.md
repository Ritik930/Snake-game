# Snake-game
The given code implements a simple Snake game using the turtle module in Python. Here's a description of the process of the Snake game:

1. Importing Libraries: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, including the turtle module and random.

2. Setting up Variables: Several variables are defined to control the game's behavior, such as the screen width and height, food size, delay between snake movements, and offsets for each direction.

3. Initializing the Game: The reset() function is defined to initialize the game state. It sets up the initial snake position, direction, and food position. The turtle objects for the snake's body (pen) and the food item are created and positioned accordingly.

4. Moving the Snake: The move_snake() function is defined to handle the snake's movement. It updates the snake's position based on the current direction. If the snake collides with itself, the game is reset. If the snake eats the food, it grows by not removing the last segment. The snake's position is adjusted to wrap around the screen edges if necessary. The turtle stamps are used to draw the snake on the screen, and the screen is updated to show the changes.

5. Food Collision: The food_collision() function checks if the snake's head collides with the food. If a collision occurs, the food's position is randomly set to a new location, and it is moved accordingly. The function returns True if there is a collision.

6. Random Food Position: The get_random_food_position() function generates a random position within the screen boundaries for the food item.

7. Calculating Distance: The get_distance() function calculates the distance between two given positions using the Euclidean distance formula.

8. Handling Keyboard Input: Four functions (go_up(), go_right(), go_down(), go_left()) are defined to change the snake's direction based on keyboard input. The snake's direction is updated only if the new direction is not opposite to the current one.

9. Setting Up the Screen: The turtle screen is set up with the specified width, height, title, and background color. The screen tracer is turned off to improve performance.

10. Listening for Keyboard Input: The screen object listens for specific keyboard inputs and triggers the respective functions to change the snake's direction.

11. Resetting and Starting the Game: The reset() function is called to initialize the game, and the turtle.done() function is used to start the game loop.

This Snake game allows the player to control the snake's movement using the arrow keys. The goal is to eat the red food, grow the snake, and avoid collisions with the snake's own body or the screen boundaries.
